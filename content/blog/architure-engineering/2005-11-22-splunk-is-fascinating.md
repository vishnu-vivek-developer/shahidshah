Take a look at [Splunk][1]. Quickly. It's one of those things that you didn't know you needed but once you see it you'll be wondering how you did without it. Their description:

> Splunk is the new way to see inside the data center. It's search software that indexes all your fast moving IT data as it happens. From one place, make sense of logs, configuration files, message queues, JMX, SNMP and database transactions from any system, application or device.
