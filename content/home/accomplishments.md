Getting healthcare technology content right and keeping it readable is really tough but somehow Tim makes it look so easy. As a fellow blogger I've often read articles on HIStalk which makes me say 'gosh, I wish I wrote that!' I've read Tim and his publications from day 1, will continue to read them on my own, and will continue to recommend them highly to everyone else who wants intelligible advice on healthcare technology."

His command of operations leadership skills has all the strengths of precision when required but with enough agility to make sure a modern SaaS based software platform like ours could succeed. He came in and systematized our delivery process, regularized customer acquisition steps, formalized our services, deepened our support team, and basically did everything that goes into making a software company successful. If you need a senior leader with significant health IT skills that knows how to get things done, Stephen's your man"
